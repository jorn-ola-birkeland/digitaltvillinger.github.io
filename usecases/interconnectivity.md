### Komplett beskrivelse av brukstilfellet: 
The Brasov municipality has developed its own Geographical Information System (GIS) a few years ago. Since then, the GIS system has been developed and is used more and more in various aspects of urban management. Currently, there are active protocols with various urban enterprises to provide relevant data to the municipality in order to update the GIS system. In the Brasov area, there are two more stakeholders who operate their own GIS system - the gas company and the water and sewage company. The municipality is hoping to develop a mechanism for the 2 private GIS systems to connect to the public GIS servers and share the updated data. The main challenge is represented by the security protocols of the gas and water companies who often do not allow the interconnectivity of these systems. A real time updating of GIS would allow for better real time information used in urban management.
