### Komplett beskrivelse av brukstilfellet: 
Now that Aarhus is producing real time data in every corner of the city, and the open data platform facilitates the possibility of tapping into this data, the SME (Small and medium enterprises) "Real time liberators" has created a broad service for citizens, journalists, the municipality and other SME's. The service is a real time 3D map of Aarhus, where it's possible to tick data sources on and off. This means that you can tick power consumption on, and immediately 3D bars will rise from the ground at specific locations. The bars are dynamically moving up and down according to measurements in the surrounding areas. Furthermore, you can tick on public transportation, and suddenly small busses will move around on the streets between the buildings. All this is accessible through a web browser and can therefore be seen on any device imaginable. This service is the real life, real time version of SimCity.
